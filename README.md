# Flappy-Bird-Reworked
A little version of Flappy Bird in C++ (with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library) I made on holidays to continue coding outside of university.

It can be played by three people at the same time, and has a score system by name.

If you are a french speaker, I invite you to check the code for more details.

## Prerequisites

- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)-2.5.1 or upper installed (Optional)

## How to use - *Linux Project*

### Compilation

Compile the program with ```make``` if you have [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)-2.5.1 or upper installed.

Compile the program with ```make nolib``` if you don't have [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)-2.5.1 or lower version installed. It will create a Shell script named ```flappyNoLib.sh```.

### Utilisation

**[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)-2.5.1 or upper installed**

Lauch the program by ```./flappy``` if you want to play solo or ```./flappy [numberOfPlayer]``` if you want many players.

**No Library installed**

Lauch the program by ```./flappyNoLib.sh``` if you to want play solo or ```./flappyNoLib.sh [numberOfPlayer]``` if you want many players.

### Gameplay

**Keys**

- *```Space```* to jump for the first player
- *```Up Arrow```* to jump for the second player
- *```Left Shift```* to jump for the third player
- *```Space```* to restart if the game has ended

When a game is started, until you hit *```Space```*, you can enter a nickname, which will be used to store your score. Note that if no nickname is entered, you will play as "Anon" nickname.

Scores are stored in a new created file which's called ```score.data```.

Only the first player can decide when the game start.

### Clean files

Clean object files, binary and even Shell script (which have been generated by ```make nolib```) by using ```make clean``` command.
